# ISEC-AMOV-ISECExplorers (Academic project)
(Arquiteturas Móveis)
(Mobile Architecture)
Finished in January 2024

I was given a project to develop an Android application that facilitates tourist visits to various locations, providing information about points of interest in these places, such as cities, mountains, beaches, islands, regions, among others. The information should be stored on a shared server/service.

## Features that were proposed to be implemented:
- Interface and user interaction
- Searches, filters, sorting, and information visualization
- Use of maps to display georeferenced information
- Creation and management of locations
- Creation and management of categories
- Creation and management of points of interest
- Confirmation process for new information
- Information removal process
- Storage and retrieval of data from a shared server/repository
- User registration and authentication
- Support for different languages (minimum English and another language; this parameter refers to messages displayed by the application itself, not those related to the information managed by the application)
- Support for different screen orientations
- Credits screen (students, discipline, academic year, course)
- Code robustness and quality (includes organization, use of standards, error handling, exceptions)
- Technical report
- User manual

## Features that weren't developed 
- Comments with image on points of interest
- Removal of points of interst

## Known bugs
- When editing a location, or a point of interest, or a category, the integrity of the votes isn't secured. Sometimes, the votes presented in the UI aren't the ones from the database.

## How to use the application 
- Run the application
- Register and account or follow to the next screen without login
- To use functionalities like "add", "remove", "edit", or "vote", you have to login

## My personal analysis of the project
This was definitely the project that I enjoyed the most. I found it very useful in order to learn about Jetpack Compose.

## Final grade
