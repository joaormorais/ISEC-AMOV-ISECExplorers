# ISEC-AMOV-ISECExplorers
(Arquiteturas Móveis)
(Mobile Architecture)
Finished in January 2024

I was given a project to develop an Android application that facilitates tourist visits to various locations, providing information about points of interest in these places, such as cities, mountains, beaches, islands, regions, among others. The information should be stored on a shared server/service.

# Features that weren't developed 

● Comments with image on points of interest
● Removal of points of interst




# Known bugs

● When editing a location, or a point of interest, or a category, the integrity of the votes isn't secured. Sometimes, the votes presented in the UI aren't the ones from the database.


# How to use the application 

● Run the application
● Register and account or follow to the next screen without login
● To use functionalities like "add", "remove", "edit", or "vote", you have to login


# My personal analysis of the project

This was definitely the project that I enjoyed the most. I found it very useful in order to learn about Jetpack Compose.
